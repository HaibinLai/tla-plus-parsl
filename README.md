# A Small TLA+ Abstraction of Parsl

This repository contains an executable, finite-state abstraction of Parsl. It is not a
line-by-line translation of the Python implementation. It preserves the control-flow
boundaries that affect observable workflow behavior: DataFlowKernel task/Future state,
executor submission, worker execution, provider capacity, retries, memoization, data
readiness, and late results.

The model was based on the Parsl paper and the current source tree, especially:

- `parsl/dataflow/states.py`: task states. The usual DFK success path is
  `pending -> launched -> exec_done`; `running`/`running_ended` are primarily monitoring-side states.
- `parsl/dataflow/dflow.py`: dependency resolution, dependency failure, memoization,
  executor submission, and completion callbacks.
- `parsl/executors/high_throughput/executor.py`: HTEX task submission, provider scaling,
  and manager capacity.
- `parsl/executors/high_throughput/interchange.py`: pending queue, manager registration,
  heartbeats, dispatch, result forwarding, and manager loss.
- `parsl/executors/high_throughput/process_worker_pool.py`: worker availability and task execution.
- `parsl/providers/base.py` and `parsl/jobs/strategy.py`: provider submit/status/cancel
  interfaces and scaling policy.
- `parsl/data_provider/data_manager.py`: the data-staging abstraction boundary.

## Logical tasks and physical attempts

The most important modeling decision is to keep a logical workflow task separate from a
physical execution attempt. An attempt is identified by `(task, retryIndex)`, so `(A,0)`
and `(A,1)` are distinct executions.

Logical task/Future states:

```text
pending -> staging -> ready -> queued -> running -> succeeded
                                      \-> retry_wait -> queued
                                      \-> failed
ready --memoization hit--> memoized
```

Physical attempt states:

```text
absent -> submitted -> serialized -> sent -> received -> decoded -> dispatched -> running -> succeeded
                                             \-> result_serialized -> result_sent
                                                 -> result_received -> result_decoded -> succeeded
                                             \-> failed
                                             \-> timed_out
                                             \-> lost
failed/timed_out/lost --late result--> stale
```

Once an old attempt is replaced, a late result can only mark that physical attempt as
`stale`; it cannot overwrite the logical Future or final result. This allows TLC to explore
retry + late-result, timeout, worker-loss, and duplicate-completion scenarios.

The provider uses `none/requested/active/failed/cancelled`; workers use `idle/busy/failed`.
`RequestAllocation`, `AllocationSucceeds`, and `AllocationFails` abstract resource request,
resource availability, and allocation failure. Memoization completes a task without creating
an attempt or consuming a worker.

Each logical task also has two abstract serialization capabilities: membership in
`CALLABLE_SERIALIZABLE` represents whether the Python function can be encoded, while
membership in `PAYLOAD_SERIALIZABLE` represents whether its arguments or closure object graph
can be encoded. `SerializeAttempt` requires both. If either capability is absent,
`SerializationFailure` rejects the attempt before a worker is assigned and applies the normal
retry bound.

## What is and is not modeled

The current model covers the major control-flow effects represented in the paper's DFK,
executor, interchange/manager, provider, and dataflow architecture. It does **not** simulate
every implementation detail or every component in full fidelity.

Deliberately abstracted away are ZMQ byte messages, serialized Python objects, callable
contents, real filenames, wall-clock time, heartbeat timing, database schema, monitoring
transport, and the exact behavior of every alternative executor/provider. Data staging is
represented only by `unavailable/staging/available`. The model therefore checks protocol
properties of a bounded abstraction; it is not a proof that the complete Parsl implementation
is correct.

The submission path now exposes an abstract message lifecycle: `SerializeAttempt` represents
encoding the task payload, `SendAttempt` and `ReceiveAttempt` represent transport across the
interchange boundary, and `DecodeAttempt` represents reconstructing the work item. Dispatch to
a worker is enabled only after decoding succeeds. Payload bytes and Python object contents remain
abstract; this stage checks ordering and failure-safe handoff rather than ZMQ or pickle behavior.

The result path has the same shape after worker execution: `SerializeResult`, `SendResult`,
`ReceiveResult`, and `DecodeResult` must occur before `AttemptSuccess` resolves the Future. A
worker or executor failure can still replace an in-flight result with a retry, so a result from
the old attempt remains eligible only for the explicit stale-result transition.

## TLC verification

The checked configurations use three logical tasks (`A`, `B`, `C`), two executors, two
workers, one retry, and one block per executor. Java and `tla2tools.jar` are required.

```bash
java -cp tla2tools.jar tlc2.TLC -deadlock -config parsl.cfg parsl.tla
java -cp tla2tools.jar tlc2.TLC -deadlock -config ParslMemo.cfg ParslAbstract.tla
java -cp tla2tools.jar tlc2.TLC -deadlock -config ParslSerializationFailure.cfg ParslAbstract.tla
java -cp tla2tools.jar tlc2.TLC -config ParslNoFailures.cfg ParslAbstract.tla
```

The first configuration checks `TypeOK`, dependency safety, terminal-state stability,
retry bounds, worker capacity/binding, valid assignments, executor availability for running
attempts, attempt identity, Future result consistency, and stale-result safety.

Measured with TLC 2.19 and Java 17 on 2026-09-28:

- `ParslAbstract.cfg`: 3,400,082 states generated, 637,157 distinct states, depth 85;
  all invariants passed.
- `ParslMemo.cfg`: 162,340 states generated, 33,651 distinct states, depth 63; all invariants passed.
- `ParslSerializationFailure.cfg`: 1,636,240 states generated, 310,025 distinct states, depth 69;
  all safety invariants passed, including the pre-dispatch serialization-failure path.
- `ParslNoFailures.cfg`: 5,322 states generated, 1,625 distinct states, depth 49;
  `EventuallySettled` passed under `WF_vars(NextCore)`.

## Source-to-model mapping

## Representative traces

Normal execution:

```text
DependencyCheck(A), Enqueue(A), RequestAllocation(E1), AllocationSucceeds(E1,W1),
SubmitAttempt(A,E1), DispatchAttempt(A,0,W1), StartAttempt(A,0,W1),
AttemptSuccess(A,0,W1),
DependencyCheck(B), Enqueue(B), SubmitAttempt(B,E1), DispatchAttempt(B,0,W1),
StartAttempt(B,0,W1), AttemptSuccess(B,0,W1),
BeginStaging(C), FinishStaging(C), DependencyCheck(C), Enqueue(C), ...,
AttemptSuccess(C,0,W1)
```

Retry plus a late result:

```text
AttemptFailure(A,0,W1), RetryTask(A), SubmitAttempt(A,E1),
DispatchAttempt(A,1,W2), StartAttempt(A,1,W2),
LateResult(A,0),                 # (A,0) becomes stale; Future(A) is unchanged
AttemptSuccess(A,1,W2)           # Future(A) accepts only attempt 1
```

Two noteworthy source/model differences are intentional: Parsl's `States.running` is mainly
observed by monitoring while the DFK success path is `pending -> launched -> exec_done`; and
the real HTEX heartbeat, batching, and ZMQ message protocol are compressed into discrete
`DispatchAttempt` and `WorkerFailure` events. The model also prevents scale-in from silently
removing a provider block with an in-flight attempt.

## Concrete Parsl example

`parsl_demo.py` runs the same three-node dataflow shape with real Parsl. It demonstrates the
mapping, but it is not itself the TLC proof object: the TLA+ `result` token only means that
the result was accepted by the abstract DFK.

```bash
python3 -m pip install parsl
python3 parsl_demo.py
```
