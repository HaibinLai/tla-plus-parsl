# Provider and scheduler models

These models cover provider allocation, polling, cancellation, status parsing, duplicate or
unknown jobs, scaling, and scheduler-specific behavior for AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Slurm,
Condor, Grid Engine, LSF, PBS Pro, Torque, Kubernetes, and local providers.

Files live in [`models/providers/`](../models/providers/).

`ParslLocalProvider.tla` models the `.ec` exit marker, process liveness, cancellation marker, and
status polling race. The current configuration allows a late successful exit marker to override a
previous cancellation request and violates `StrictCancellation`; the fixed configuration gives
cancellation precedence. `tests/test_local_provider_runtime.py` reproduces the same behavior with
a fake `.ec` file and a dead process.
